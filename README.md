Implementation notes:
- Implemented required functionality
- Implemented offline data access with Core Data and Alamofire caching. Poster caching is handled by SDWebImage. Trailers don't play offline.
- Implemented search functionality
- Some parts of the app implemented with TDD, so tests included
- Trailer videos display is handled by WKWebView and YouTube iframe API https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference

Implementation took around 12 hours.
